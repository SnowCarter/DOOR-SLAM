# Flash Jetpack 4.2 on NVIDIA Jetson TX2
For this step, we use NVIDIA's SDK manager.

Download the SDK manager here: https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack.

Install it, and then you can open it typing `sdkmanager` in a terminal.

Follow the SDK manager instructions to flash your TX2 and make sure to install the CUDA libraries.
